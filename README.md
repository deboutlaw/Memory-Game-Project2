# Memory Game
This is an browser based card game to use your memory! There are 16 cards so 8 pairs to find. The game will time your play, count your moves and give you a star rating .  When you click on a card a symbol is revealed and if the next card you click has a matching symbol the cards will remain face up, if not they do not. Each time you start over and play again the game will shuffle the cards so you came play over and over!

##Functionality
This game relies on `JavaScript` and `jQuery`  to function.
The code does this by:
*creating a list of cards that are then looped through to create their HTML which is then added to the page
*an event listener is used so when a card is clicked  multiple functions are called to run
*functions are created to:
	-deal with the cards clicked
	-update the scoreboard
	-create the modal functionality
	-check if game over
	-create timer functionality
	-shuffle the cards
	-restart game
